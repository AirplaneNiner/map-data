# Getting started
To start mapping, please join MRT-Map's Discord server and ping @7d#5755 for the Mapper role. This role will give you access to a private channel where you can see some tutorials about mapping the server.

# Mapping and Contributing to the Main Repository
blahdiblah @7d add stuff. Fork repo blah blah. All pull requests must target the `development` branch. This branch will then be merged into `main` at the discretion of 7d, and these changes will be deployed to the map itself.
